1- json.load() reads JSON from a file object but json.loads() reads from a string
2- csv.reader returns rows as lists but csv.DictReader returns rows as dictionaries with column headers as keys
3- Pandas offers easier handling of missing data, type inference, and advanced operations like filtering and grouping
4- Use pd.ExcelWriter with engine='openpyxl' and specify sheet_name in df.to_excel()
5- JSON supports nested structures and data types but CSV is flat and requires all rows to have same columns
