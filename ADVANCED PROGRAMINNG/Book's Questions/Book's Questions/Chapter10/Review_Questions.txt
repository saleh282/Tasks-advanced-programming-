==> Short Answer / Conceptual Questions :
=====================================
1- A generator produces values lazily using yield, while a coroutine can also 
consume values sent into it using send(). Coroutines are often used for event-driven 
programming and concurrency.

2- The with statement ensures resources (like files, sockets, or locks) are automatically cleaned up via __exit__(), even if an exception occurs, making code 
safer and cleaner. 

3- In a stock trading app, multiple UI components (observers) need to be 
updated whenever stock prices (subject state) change.

4- It abstracts object creation, allowing clients to create objects without 
depending on their concrete classes.

5- It allows dependencies (like services or databases) to be swapped out with 
mock objects during testing, making unit tests easier and more isolated.
